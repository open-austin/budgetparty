## Project Description

Austin Budget Party has been [awarded a Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund grant](https://learning.mozilla.org/blog/mozilla-awards-241000-to-explore-the-intersection-of-gigabit-technology-and-civics-robotics-farming-and-more) to help design and develop a **Digital Mock City Council** experience with [austinbudget.party](https://austinbudget.party/).

The goal of the grant is to create an online, open-source, digital budget debate platform and curriculum designed for middle and high school students to explore civic challenges and priorities.

Open Austin contributors partnered with the [Capital of Texas Media Foundation](https://www.cotmf.org/), publisher of the [Austin Monitor](http://www.austinmonitor.com/), to improve the budget app, develop a teaching curriculum, and implement the program in 10 pilots schools in Austin.

You can read more on our [blog post](https://www.open-austin.org/blog/2017/02/08/budget-party-mozilla-gigabit-grant-announcement) announcing the grant and from the [original project proposal](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/70).

## Roadmap

At this stage, we have:

1. A working prototype (version 0.0) [austinbudget.party](http://austinbudget.party/). This prototype was used at our first Game Night with Glasshouse Policy. This is the [feedback](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/66) we got.
2. Designs for version 1.0 of Budget Party. See examples [here](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/74#issuecomment-284244078) and [here](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/73#issuecomment-284243962). [Sketch File](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/files/880263/budgetParty-v2.2.sketch.zip)
3. Tested the prototype at a Budget Game Nights and in a high school classroom.

**For the 1.0 release, we are working on:**

- A curriculum to provide context for middle school and high school students for understanding how the City Council makes decisions.
- [Information Architecture](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/79) and improved user workflows.
- [District Profiles](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/80) for users to learn about City Council demographics.
- Page Redesigns.
- [Login](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/72) & [save session data](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/75).
- New icons and [imagery](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/71).
- Other [technical](https://github.com/open-austin/budgetparty/issues/43) improvements.

Our target launch for v1.0 is May 7, 2017.

We presented the game and curriculum to AISD high school departments chairs on April 11, 2017.

Teachers will implement the instructional tools in May 2017.

v1.1 will follow with feedback from user testing and teachers.
